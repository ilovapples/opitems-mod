## Build
If you want pre-releases (usually won't be very polished on the new bits), check out the Actions tab!  
The latest action's artifact is a .zip file containing the .jar file for the latest pre-release.  
<br />
`git clone` the repo, navigate to it, and run one of the following in the terminal/command prompt:
- On Windows:
  - `gradlew.bat build`
  - Or run `BUILD_MOD.bat`
- On Linux/MacOS X:
  - `./gradlew build`
  - Or run `BUILD_MOD.sh` with `bash`
  
The .jar file will be in the build/libs directory.
